# Emotion Analyzer 

### Live Demo  
ðŸ”— Try it here: [Emotion Analyzer](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Shaaranii12/emotion-analyzer)  

## Overview  
The **Emotion Analyzer** is a machine learning project that classifies emotions from text input.  

It uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to classify text into emotions like anger, joy, sadness, fear, surprise, disgust, and neutral. The app was built with **Gradio** for the user interface and deployed on **Hugging Face Spaces** for public access.  

This project is part of my data science portfolio and demonstrates skills in NLP, deep learning, and interactive app deployment. 

## Features  
âœ… Text Input: Enter any sentence and instantly analyze its emotion. <br>
âœ… Prediction Results: Displays the detected emotion. <br>
âœ… Interactive App: Simple and user-friendly interface for real-time emotion detection.  

## Screenshots
The model was fine-tuned using the j-hartmann/emotion-english-distilroberta-base transformer, and evaluated to measure its performance across different emotion categories
